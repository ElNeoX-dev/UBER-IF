# **Glossary**

1. **_Application_**: The software system designed for optimizing delivery tours in cities using bicycles.
2. **_City Map_**: A digital representation of a city's layout, including intersections and road segments, used for planning delivery tours.
3. **_Intersection_**: A point where two or more roads meet in the city map, characterized by its geographical coordinates : latitude and longitude.
4. **_Latitude:_** The geographic coordinate that specifies the north-south position of a point on the Earth's surface.
5. **_Longitude:_** The geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface.
6. **_Road Segment_**: A stretch of road connecting two intersections, with attributes like origin, destination, name, and length.
7. **_XML File_**: A file format used to describe the city map, including details of intersections, road segments, and the warehouse address.

14. **_Address:_** The specific location for a delivery, typically including details like street name, number, city, and sometimes latitude and longitude coordinates.
15. **_Travel Speed:_** The assumed constant speed of the couriers, used for calculating tour durations and feasibility.
16. **_Delivery Performance Time:_** The time taken to perform a delivery, assumed to be a constant (e.g., five minutes).
17. **_User:_** The person operating the application, responsible for loading maps, inputting delivery requests, and managing couriers.
