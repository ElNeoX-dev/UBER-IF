For a sprint planning for a team of seven members over four sessions, focusing on the inception phase of your project, it's important to allocate tasks effectively to meet all deliverables. Here's a suggested sprint plan:

### Team Members:

4. Noham: Back-End developper 
5. Mark: Back-End developper _Product owner_
6. Evann: Back-End developper
7. Zyad: Front-End developper

### Sprint Duration:

4 Sessions

### Deliverables:

1. Glossary
2. Use Case Diagram
3. Main Success Scenario Description
4. Structured Description of Analyzed/Implemented Use Cases
5. Class and Package Diagrams
6. Actual Planning of the First Iteration
7. Demo Preparation

### Session Breakdown and Task Allocation:

#### Session 1:

- **Fiona & George**: Start organizing and preparing for the demo with the client.
- **All Members**: Review and integrate all deliverables, prepare for the demo presentation.

### Notes:

- **Collaboration**: Team members should regularly communicate and collaborate to ensure consistency and integration between different parts of the project.
- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adjust roles and responsibilities based on progress and unforeseen challenges.
- **Review Sessions**: At the end of each session, have a brief meeting to track progress and address any issues.
- **Demo Preparation**: Ensure that the demo is not only a presentation but also a demonstration of the operational aspects of the software developed so far.

This plan is a guideline and may need to be adapted based on the team's pace, understanding of the project, and any specific instructions from the course or client. Regular communication and flexibility will be key to the success of the sprint.
