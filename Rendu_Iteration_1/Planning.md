6. Evann: Back-End developper
7. Zyad: Front-End developper

### Sprint Duration:

4 Sessions with 4 hours per session

### Deliverables:

1. Glossary
2. Use Case Diagram
3. Main Success Scenario Description
4. Structured Description of Analyzed/Implemented Use Cases
5. Class and Package Diagrams
6. Actual Planning of the First Iteration

This plan is a guideline and may need to be adapted based on the team's pace, understanding of the project, and any specific instructions from the course or client. Regular communication and flexibility will be key to the success of the sprint.
